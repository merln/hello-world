All creativity comes from within. Over the years, I have connected with, found, my Creative Self and learned how to converse with him. He set rules up that limited what I could see in the conversation.  I had to ask, "Is there a better way to do THIS, any this?" If I got a YES, then, I was invited to keep asking until I got another YES and so on.

After several YESes, I would start to get a mental image of the invention (alloy, field, waveform or device). This mental image was in color, high-definition, could be assembled and disasembled, could be rotated, could be zoomed in or out, could be looked at from any angle or perspective. I could even measure each of the parts and find out what each part was made from (that required a lot more questions).

One day, my Creative Self told me that he was Nicola Tesla when he was here in his last lifetime.

When you visit my website, you will be astonished at how many new technologies there are waiting to come into the world. I have had to wait until we were firmly in the new, Aquarian Energy which is Female, find-your-own-way, freedom-driven, truth-driven, choosing-driven and is individual based; not collective based.
